# Ford go bike trips Feb 2019 San Francisco

What is the structure of your dataset?
There are 183,412 trips in this dataset in Feb 2019 in San Francisco with information of each trip's starting station (station name, id, longtitude, latitude), end station (station name, id, longtitude, latitude), start time (date & hour), end time (date & hour), duration, who the rider was (their gender, age, user type), and which bike it was (shared bike or not, and bike id). There are 329 stations in San Francisco, and a total of 4646 bikes.

What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
1) I'm interested in investigating which stations are operating at their max capacity, and which stations are operating at a lost.
2) Besides that, I want to know which days and hours are the busiest and least busy, and some strategies to maximize the "dead hours" (least busy).

What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
1) I think that other features like duration span and number of bikes are parked at each stations would be good indicators to determine which stations are operating at their fullest capacity or at a loss.
2) I think other demographic data such as member's birth year, gender, and user type can help me understand the peak days and hours better.
